    <string name="about_app_text_description">Pomodoro app is the implementation of the Pomodoro productivity technique. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. A goal of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow. A pomodoro is indivisible; when interrupted during a pomodoro, either the other activity must be recorded and postponed, or the pomodoro must be abandoned</string>
